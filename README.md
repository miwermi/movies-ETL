(ETL: Extract Transform and Load)

Creating consistent, robust data storage systems with data relationships that maintain data integrity and efficient querying performance is what the ETL process strives for. In this project, data was extracted from two different web sources, then supplied for cleaning, to be loaded into a new database. The cleaning process was intense.

## About the project:

Amazing Prime Video is the world's largest online retailer.  They also have a platform that streams movies and tv shows.  They have sponsored a hackathon to see if data nerds can figure out a way to loop through video data and identify low-budget films that will have demand - so they can purchase the streaming rights on the cheap. 

Data sources supplied include:  

 - Wikipedia info all movies released since 1990
 - MovieLens rating dataPV
